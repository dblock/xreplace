	This code has been derived from work by Henry Spencer.
	The main changes are
	1. All char variables and functions have been changed to char
	   counterparts
	2. Added GetFindLen() & GetReplaceString() to enable search
	   and replace operations.
	3. And of course, added the C++ Wrapper

	^	Beginning of the string. The expression "^A" will match an ‘A’ only at the beginning of the string.
	^	The caret (^) immediately following the left-bracket ([) has a different meaning. It is used to exclude the remaining characters within brackets from matching the target string. The expression "[^0-9]" indicates that the target character should not be a digit.
	$	The dollar sign ($) will match the end of the string. The expression "abc$" will match the sub-string "abc" only if it is at the end of the string.

	|	The alternation character (|) allows either expression on its side to match the target string. The expression "a|b" will match ‘a’ as well as ‘b’.
	.	The dot (.) will match any character.
	*	The asterisk (*) indicates that the character to the left of the asterisk in the expression should match 0 or more times.
	+	The plus (+) is similar to asterisk but there should be at least one match of the character to the left of the + sign in the expression.
	?	The question mark (?) matches the character to its left 0 or 1 times.

	()	The parenthesis affects the order of pattern evaluation and also serves as a tagged expression that can be used when replacing the matched sub-string with another expression.
	[ ]	Brackets ([ and ]) enclosing a set of characters indicates that any of the enclosed characters may match the target character.


	The parenthesis, besides affecting the evaluation order of the regular expression, also serves as tagged expression which is something like a temporary memory. This memory can then be used when we want to replace the found expression with a new expression. The replace expression can specify a & character which means that the & represents the sub-string that was found. So, if the sub-string that matched the regular expression is "abcd", then a replace expression of "xyz&xyz" will change it to "xyzabcdxyz". The replace expression can also be expressed as "xyz\0xyz". The "\0" indicates a tagged expression representing the entire sub-string that was matched. Similarly we can have other tagged expression represented by "\1", "\2" etc. Note that although the tagged expression 0 is always defined, the tagged expression 1,2 etc. are only defined if the regular expression used in the search had enough sets of parenthesis. Here are few examples.
